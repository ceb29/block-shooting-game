# block-shooting-game
A simple python game I made to practice using classes in python and learn more about how old school games work. Made using pygame.

Controls:
-mouse to move
-right click to shoot
-scroll wheel to rotate player
-press enter to try again
-press esc to exit

Rules:
-each round player ammo and block count are the same
-gain 1 ammo for each block shot
-blocks spawn on window outskirts
-game is over if player runs out of ammo or hits block
